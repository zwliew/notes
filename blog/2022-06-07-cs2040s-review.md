## Summary
The content was interesting and the last few questions of each tutorial were usually interesting. The lack of proofs was somewhat disappointing. The workload was quite high due to the many problemsets and the infuriating grader platform. I spent more time on this module than CS2100 and CS2106, but less time compared to CS2030S.

## Topics
Orders of growth, sorting, balanced binary search trees, various other trees, hash tables, simple amortized analysis, graph searching algorithms, shortest path algorithms, topological sorts, minimum spanning trees, heaps, union find data structure, dynamic programming.

## Content
While there may seem like a lot of content, much of it is intuitive and can be derived from a few core definitions and invariants. Having a solid grounding in discrete math, especially proofs and combinatorics, helps.

I was a bit disappointed at the lack of (rigorous) proofs for many of the claims taught, especially those involving randomization or probability.

## Professors
Prof Seth is an enthusiastic and competent teacher. I enjoyed his teaching and highly recommend taking classes under him.

## Workload
- a 1-hour and a 2-hour lecture per week. Negligible EXP given as EXP.
- a 2-hour tutorial every week. Level of participation is counted as EXP.
- a 1-hour recitation every week. Negligible EXP given.
- a quiz after every lecture. EXP is awarded.
- a problemset after every 1-2 lectures. EXP is awarded.
- some optional coding practices to farm EXP if you need more.
- a 2-hour midterm
- a 2-hour final

Some percentage of our grades goes to a gamified learning system on Coursemology where we have to gain EXP to level up. The max level is level 35, which most people should obtain if they are diligent with assignments.

The lecture slides were highly understandable which is great if you don't want to watch the lectures.

The last few questions of every tutorial were quite insightful and enjoyable to tackle.

The problemsets took up a lot of time. What's more infuriating is that Coursemology, the grader platform, does not provide meaningful error messages so esoteric bugs are much harder to catch (i.e. using an unsupported Java feature or using an incompatible character set).
