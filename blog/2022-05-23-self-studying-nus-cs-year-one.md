# Self-studying the NUS Computer Science Year 1 curriculum

In the National University of Singapore (NUS), freshmen typically study the following modules (courses):

1. CS1101S (Programming Methodology)
2. CS1231S (Discrete Structures)
3. CS2030S (Programming Methodology II)
4. CS2040S (Data Structures & Algorithms)
5. CS2100 (Computer Organisation)

It turns out that all of these can be self-studied without even enrolling in an official Computer Science (CS) programme. Here's how.

## CS1101S (Programming Methodology)

CS1101S is the introductory CS course that most freshmen take, except for those who place out of it. I am part of the latter group, so I do not have first-hand experience of this course. However, based on what I know from my coursemates, CS1101S is largely based on the the book [Structrue and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html); it teaches functional programming through the language Source, which is best described as a subset of JavaScript. This course is known for its grueling workload, but the gamified programming environment called SourceAcademy somewhat makes up for it.

I don't know of any free resource or course that replaces CS1101S. However -- take it from someone who placed out of the course and did not feel set back at all -- any well-known introductory CS course should suffice. Ultimately, most introductory CS courses teach computational thinking and basic programming skills. This course is no exception.

So, here are some courses which I think should sufficiently replace this course:

1. [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python (MIT's 6.0001)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
2. [Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard's CS50x)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)

## CS1231S (Discrete Structures)

CS1231S is your run-of-the-mill discrete mathematics course, which covers a hodgepodge of topics involving "discrete" objects. It covers topics including logic and proofs, set theory, relations, mathematical induction, functions, cardinality, combinatorics and probability, and graph theory. Some discrete mathematics courses include other topics like number theory.

As mentioned in [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#math), the course I most recommend for studying this course is [Mathematics for Computer Science (MIT's 6.024J)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/). Notably, I recommend the Fall 2010 revision over the 2015 revision as Prof Tom Leighton taught the former, and I greatly appreciate his teaching.

The course is accompanied by an equivalently-named textbook (linked in the course site). I recommend reading through the textbook chapter by chapter as it helps to internalise the content. In fact, in my opinion, reading the textbook and completing the problem sets is sufficient. Watch the lectures only if you have the time and/or you learn better with them.
