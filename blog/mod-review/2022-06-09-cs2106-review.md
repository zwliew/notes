## Summary
The content was useful but superficial. The labs were uninteresting. The module is somewhat difficult but that's mainly because of the amount of content taught and the lack of association with real-world examples. The workload was highly manageable and less than CS2040S, CS2030S, and CS2100.

## Topics
Processes and threads, process scheduling, inter-process communication, synchronization, memory management (including virtual memory) and file systems. Most concepts were taught in relation to how Unix works such as Unix syscalls. Specific file system case studies include ext2 and FAT.

## Content
Like CS2100, CS2106 is a "content" module where quite a lot of content is taught and the bulk of the work lies in understanding it.

I was disappointed at how abstract most of the topics taught were. The professors could've brought in examples of real-world implementations of the topics, such as those in the Linux kernel.

## Professors
The professors' teaching didn't leave much of an impression on me. They explain concepts well and it was enjoyable listening to their lectures.

That said, there were some gaps in teaching. To fill in those gaps, I had to conduct self-research on some topics and ask questions on the forum. There were also weekly office hours for students to consult the professors.

## Workload
- a 2-hour lecture per week. Does not contribute to grades.
- a 1-hour tutorial per week. Does not contribute to grades.
- a graded quiz every week. Takes about 10 minutes on average to complete.
- 4 graded lab assignments spread over the course of the semester.
- a 2-hour midterm
- a 2-hour final

The lecture slides were incomplete and were not understandable alone so I had to watch all the lectures. The tutorials were not strictly necessary for doing well, but they helped reinforce concepts and teach techniques to answer questions.

The labs required us to implement programs that demonstrated OS concepts. We were given around 2 weeks to complete each lab, which was usually more than enough time. I found the labs disappointing. They could've been designed to be more insightful, such as by letting us implement simple OS subsystems.
