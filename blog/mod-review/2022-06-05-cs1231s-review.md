## Description
This module teaches discrete mathematics. Topics include logic and proofs, sets, relations, mathematical induction, functions, cardinality, counting and probability, and graph theory. Unfortunately, number theory is replaced by cardinality, which is a decision I personally dislike.

## Professors
Prof Aaron is highly enthusiastic and I enjoy attending his lectures. Prof Lawrence is also competent. However, for efficiency, I mostly read the slides or watch the recordings instead of attending live lectures.

## Content
There is not a lot of content, especially when compared to CS2100. Furthermore, I feel like graph theory is taught too superficially. That said, the difficulty of the content comes from the need for intuition and a strong understanding of the definitions that are taught. Also, I would've preferred to learn number theory instead of cardinality, though having both would be the best.

## Workload
Besides midterms and finals, there are 2 graded assignments and weekly tutorials. Tutorials are not graded but attendance is taken. Overall, I find the workload pretty light, especially when compared to CS2100. That said, it depends on how quickly one is able to grasp the concepts and do the assignments.

## Conclusion
8/10. This module is vital for any CS student. I thoroughly enjoyed it. That being said, to maximise learning, I would consider taking MA1100/T instead.
