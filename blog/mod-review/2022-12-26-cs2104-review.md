# CS2104 Programming Language Concepts review

Taken in AY22/23 Semester 1 under Prof Chin Wei Ngan. 

## Topics
- Lambda calculus
- Haskell. Focus on features common to functional languages like typeclasses, functors, monads, algebraic data types, and pattern matching.
- Prolog. We are mostly taught how to use it but only a little about how it works.
- Scala. Focus on monadic parsing.

## Lectures
Lectures are slow and dry. The slides are also sparse and hence difficult to comprehend. Self-studying the content online is more effective.

## Tutorials
Weekly tutorial worksheets are interesting and worth attempting. The professor conducts weekly tutorial sessions to review the questions. Solutions are uploaded shortly after each tutorial session. Unlike the worksheets, tutorial sessions are mostly a waste of time.
 
## Assessment
- Tutorial attendance (10%)
- 4 lab assignments (35%)
- 1 mid-term quiz (15%)
- 1 final examination (40%) 

There are 4 take-home lab assignments, all of which are challenging and fulfilling exercises. We are given a few weeks to complete each assignment.
- Lab 1 was a written assignment on lambda calculus.
- Labs 2 and 3 were programming assignments in Haskell.
- Lab 4 was a programming assignment in Prolog.

The mid-term quiz is an MCQ quiz that tests our understanding of lambda calculus and Haskell. In a sense, we are tested on our ability as a manual Haskell compiler.

The final examination comprises an MCQ portion and an open-ended portion. The MCQ portion primarily tests the same content as the mid-term quiz but also includes questions on Prolog and Scala. The open-ended part involves written "programming" questions on Haskell, Prolog, and Scala.

## Summary
I like the course content and enjoyed attempting the tutorial worksheets and lab assignments. Examinations are okay-ish. Everything else is terrible. Self-studying is required to learn and understand the content well.
