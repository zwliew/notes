## Summary
The content was interesting, but the lectures and recitations were pretty boring. The lab assignments were mostly a chore, and programming in Java is a huge pain. The workload was comparable to CS2040S (probably less).

## Topics
Object-oriented programming, type systems, functional programming, concurrent and parallel programming.

## Content
This module was mainly about introducing several concepts in programming, each to a fairly superficial level. It was pretty interesting learning all these, but the lack of depth made it less enjoyable.

## Professors
I didn't enjoy watching their lectures and ended up solely relying on the lecture notes and the Q&A forums. This is mostly because the lectures didn't really teach anything useful outside of the well-written lecture notes.

## Workload
- a 2-hour lecture every week. Ungraded.
- a 1-hour recitation every week. Ungraded.
- a 2-hour lab every week. The lab session can be skipped, but the take-home lab assignments are graded.
- a MCQ quiz after every lecture. Graded and took <10 min each.
- 2 2-hour practical exams. Involved implementing programs according to given specifications.
- a 2-hour midterm. MCQ and short answer questions.
- a 2-hour final. MCQ and short answer questions.

The lab assignments make up the bulk of the workload. They start simple, but progressively ramp up in difficulty. The last few assignments were pretty difficult and could take a day or so to complete. Programming in Java was not enjoyable either.

## Ratings

Enjoyment: 4/10
