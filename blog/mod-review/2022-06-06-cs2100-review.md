## Description
This module teaches us about how CPUs and memory work. Topics taught include the C language, the MIPS architecture, processor datapath and control, boolean algebra, logic circuits, pipelining and caching. Performance is included but is not examinable.

## Professors
Both professors are highly enthusiastic and I enjoy attending their lectures. However, for efficiency, I mostly read the slides or watch the recordings instead of attending live lectures.

## Content
There is a decently large amount of content, but they are mostly conceptually mangeable. Personally, I would've liked some of the time spent on C to be spent on other content. The main difficulty of the content lies in that there are a lot of tedious calculations. One must be fast and accurate when doing them.

## Workload
Besides midterms and finals, there are 3 graded assignments, weekly tutorials, and weekly labs. Tutorials are not graded but attendance is taken. For labs, students are required to complete a 1-2 page worksheet. Labs are graded and attendance is taken. Overall, I find the workload pretty light. That said, it depends on how quickly one is able to grasp the concepts and do the labs and assignments.

## Conclusion
9/10. This module is vital for any CS student -- especially for one interested in low-latency/concurrent programming. It is also taught by two excellent professors. I enjoyed this module, and am looking forward to CS2106.
